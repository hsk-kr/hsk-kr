 ### Hi, there, I'm Seongkuk Han ðŸ‘‹
I worked as a frontend engineer for about two years in South Korea, primarily focusing on React. Although I mostly worked in Frontend, I also have a desire to get experience in different areas of software development. I am dedicated, enthusiastic about my work and enjoy working with colleges. 

Recently, I moved to Frankfurt with a working holiday visa to achieve my long-time goal of working abroad, and I am currently working on improving my English skills and actively seeking opportunities with companies in Germany.

Please feel free to contact me.
