 ### Hi, there, I'm Seongkuk Han ðŸ‘‹
I am a frontend engineer with industry experience building web applications, specializing in JavaScript and React. I have honed my programming skills through self-taught projects, and I enjoy collaborating with my coworkers. I am really passionate about my work, and view advice as a learning opportunity.

Recently, I moved to Frankfurt on a working holiday visa to achieve my long-time goal of working abroad. As I aspire to work for companies that use English as their official language, I am currently studying to improve my communication skills. I am actively seeking opportunities with companies in Germany, and I welcome any leads or contacts you may have.
