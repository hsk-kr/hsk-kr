 ### Hi, there, I'm Seongkuk Han ðŸ‘‹
As a frontend engineer with over 2 years of experience in building and maintaining web applications, I possess proficiency in React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. Additionally, I have gained secondary experience in Node.js and Python.

My passion for the field has driven me to pursue opportunities for growth and development, which led me to relocate to Germany to broaden my experience as a developer. I am now actively seeking a dynamic team where I can contribute my full dedication and expertise.

I have a strong commitment to learning and continually improving my skills. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my knowledge to contribute to the success of the organization I join.

Please feel free to contact me.
