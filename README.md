 ### Hi, there, I'm Seongkuk Han ðŸ‘‹
I worked as a frontend engineer for three years in South Korea, primarily focusing on React. Although I mostly worked in frontend, I have a desire to get experience in different areas of software development. I am an easy-going person and enjoy working with my coworkers. 

Recently, I moved to Frankfurt with a working holiday visa to achieve my long-time goal of working abroad. I am currently studying to improve my English skills and actively seeking opportunities with companies in Germany. 

Please feel free to contact me.
I genuinely miss working and am fully prepared to dedicate myself to my first job in this country.
